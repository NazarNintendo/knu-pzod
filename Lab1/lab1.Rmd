Preparation.  
```{r}
data <- read.csv("airquality.csv")
```

Question 1. What are the column names of the data frame?
```{r}
colnames(data)
```

Question 2. What are the row names of the data frame?
```{r}
rownames(data)
```

Question 3. Extract the first 6 rows of the data frame and print them to the console
```{r}
head(data)
```

Question 4. How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?
```{r}
nrow(data)
```

Question 5. Extract the last 6 rows of the data frame and print them to the console
```{r}
tail(data)
```

Question 6. How many missing values are in the “Ozone” column of this data frame?
```{r}
sum(is.na(data$Ozone))
```

Question 7. What is the mean of the “Ozone” column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.
```{r}
mean(data$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Question 8. Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90.
```{r}
subset(data, data$Ozone > 31 & data$Temp > 90)
```

Question 9. Use a for loop to create a vector of length 6 containing the mean of each column in the data frame (excluding all missing values).
```{r}
vector <- c()
for (i in 1:6)
  vector <- append(vector, mean(data[,i], na.rm = TRUE))
vector
```

Question 10. Use the apply function to calculate the standard deviation of each column in the data frame (excluding all missing values).
```{r}
sapply(data, function(x) sd(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Question 11. Calculate the mean of “Ozone” for each Month in the data frame and create a vector containing the monthly means (exclude all missing values).
```{r}
monthly_means <- aggregate(data$Ozone, list(data$Month), function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
monthly_means$x
```
Question 12. Draw a random sample of 5 rows from the data frame
```{r}
data[sample(nrow(data), 5),]
```
