# 1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?
# Make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years
# 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
NEI_1 <- NEI %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(total_emissions = sum(Emissions))
barplot(NEI_1$total_emissions ~ NEI_1$year, main="Total emissions", xlab="Year", ylab="Emissions, tons")

# Answer: Yes, they have.

# 2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008?
NEI_2 <- NEI[NEI$fips == "24510",] %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(total_emissions = sum(Emissions))

        xlab="Year", ylab="Emissions, tons")

# Answer: Yes, they have.

# 3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad)
# variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for
# Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?

        ylab="Emissions, tons",
        col=c("darkblue","red", "green", "yellow"), legend = unique(NEI_3$year), beside=TRUE)

# Answer: Nonroad, nonpoint, onroad have decreased. Point have increased.

#  4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources
# changed from 1999–2008?
coal_sources <- SCC[grepl("coal", SCC$Short.Name),]

        xlab="Year", ylab="Emissions, tons")

# Answer: Decreased.

#  5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore
# City (EI.Sector starts from “Mobile”)?
motor_vehicle_sources <- SCC[startsWith(as.character(SCC$EI.Sector), "Mobile"),]
NEI_5 <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% motor_vehicle_sources$SCC & NEI$fips == "24510",] %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(total_emissions = sum(Emissions))
barplot(NEI_5$total_emissions ~ NEI_5$year, main="Total emissions from motor vehicle sources in the Baltimore City, Maryland", 
        xlab="Year", ylab="Emissions, tons")

# Answer: Decreased.

#  6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from
# motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which
# city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
motor_vehicle_sources <- SCC[startsWith(as.character(SCC$EI.Sector), "Mobile"),]
NEI_6 <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% motor_vehicle_sources$SCC & NEI$fips %in% c("24510", "06037"),] %>% group_by(year, fips) %>% summarise(total_emissions = sum(Emissions))
NEI_6

        xlab="Year", ylab="Emissions, tons",
        col=c("darkblue","red"), legend = unique(NEI_3$fips), beside=TRUE)

# Answer: Los Angeles County, California slightly increased. Baltimore City, Maryland - decreased.
